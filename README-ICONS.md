# Creating App Icons

The app needs two icon files to work as an installable PWA:
- `icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels)

## Quick Method: Use the Generator

1. Open `create-icons.html` in any web browser
2. Right-click on the first canvas image and select "Save image as..."
3. Save as `icon-192.png` in the MOAcalc folder
4. Right-click on the second canvas image and select "Save image as..."
5. Save as `icon-512.png` in the MOAcalc folder

## Alternative: Create Your Own

Use any graphics editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, etc.) to create:
- 192x192 PNG
- 512x512 PNG
- Design suggestion: Crosshair or target design on blue background
- Save as `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`

## For Now

The app will work without icons, but you won't see a nice icon on your home screen until you add them.
